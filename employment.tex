Several new variables were found that provide significant improvements in sensitivity for a variety of Higgs boson and new particle searches. Developed and productionised core software and algorithms for real-time data analysis.\\
%Contributed to core software framework for real-time data 
%& Systematically investigated the potential benefit of hundreds of different hadronic event shape variables and jet shape variables for a variety of new physics searches (SM Higgs $WH \rightarrow \ell\nu\,b\bar{b}$, Hidden Valley Higgs $H\rightarrow\pi_\mathrm{v}\pi_\mathrm{v}\rightarrow{b\bar{b}}{b\bar{b}}$, hadronic decays of colour octet scalars and excited $W$ bosons) and for quark/gluon tagging. Variables include my own inventions and those compiled from a thorough survey of relevant literature. Several new promising variables were found that provide significant additional discrimination power against QCD background. They have the potential for significant impact on many new physics searches.

%%, as an alternative to using higher energy thresholds and prescaling.\\ Given that the jet triggers are amongst those that will be prescaled aggressively as instantaneous luminosity increases, it is urgent to consider using tighter cuts as an alternative to using higher energy thresholds and prescaling. 
%% Have investigated the potential benefit of hundreds of different event shapes and jet shapes for both Higgs and exotics offline analyses
%% Many of these are my own inventions, the rest are those that I encountered during a thorough survey of the relevant papers and literature
%% Long-term goal was to develop a new trigger for the jet slice that uses event shapes or jet shapes that have come to light in the past few years
%% ~400 event shapes, ~600 jet shapes
%% Preliminary results shows that these variables have limited dependencies on event kinematics and pile-up conditions

%&\\ %% why is vertex trigger important -- strassler. interface
%& Worked on improving and adapting the trigger algorithm and the offline vertexing tools to enable selection of events with highly-displaced vertices due to the decay of long-lived neutral particles that arise in new physics models, such as Hidden Valley and R-parity violating \SUSY. The trigger algorithm and offline vertexing were each run on simulated Hidden Valley $H\rightarrow\pi_\mathrm{v}\pi_\mathrm{v}\rightarrow{b\bar{b}}{b\bar{b}}$ events to identify deficiencies and to explore distributions of relevant discriminant variables to optimise cuts for online selection and offline physics analysis.\\
%%& Performed trigger software validation duties for the $b$-jet trigger slice, which involved diagnosing problems, bug reporting, tracking problems to solution, and representation in software validation meetings.\\
%
%& Developed a trigger algorithm for enabling secondary vertex based $b$-tagging to be performed at the \EF. Demonstrated that this trigger algorithm runs safely within the the times constraints of the \EF and is now included in the physics trigger menu. Work is proceeding on comparisons of the online implementation with the performance of offline secondary vertex algorithms to optimise algorithm parameters. Performed trigger software validation duties for the $b$-jet trigger slice, which involved diagnosing problems, bug reporting, and tracking problems to solution. Recent focus has been on examination of the feasibility of adapting the algorithm to enable triggering on events with highly-displaced vertices due to long-lived neutral particles that arise in new physics models such as Hidden Valley models and R-parity violating \SUSY. The trigger algorithm has been run on simulated Hidden Valley $H\rightarrow\pi_\mathrm{v}\pi_\mathrm{v}\rightarrow{b\bar{b}}{b\bar{b}}$ events to identify deficiencies and to explore distributions of relevant discriminant variables to optimise selection.\\
