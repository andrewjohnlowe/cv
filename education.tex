%& Demonstrated that the electron trigger is robust against the effects of both dead cells and dead \FEBs in the electromagnetic calorimeter; determined that the trigger efficiency for benchmark physics channels $\W\rightarrow\enu$, $\Z\rightarrow\ee$ and $H\rightarrow\ZZstar\rightarrow\eeee$ decreases by no more than 1\% per 1\% increase in dead cells or dead \FEBs.\\

& Played a major role in the development of the core software and algorithms in \Cplusplus for a real-time multi-stage cascade classifier that filters and reduces the collision event data rate from 60\TBs to a manageable 300\MBs that can be written to permanent storage. Performed detailed time profiling of the core software and devised improvements that made it 8 times faster, thus meeting a critical requirement of the system. Wrote \htmladdnormallink{software that was used in the discovery of the Higgs boson}{https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0512}.\\
%& Spent two years working in a team developing the \HLT software framework. Made numerous key contributions to the \HLT algorithm steering mechanism during the early stages of its development. Developed a \htmladdnormallink{trigger algorithm}{http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=a022027} widely used as an exemplar by algorithm developers integrating their code with the \HLT software framework.

%% The team benefited from my rigorous approach and attention to detail. 

%% Was able to apply the skills acquired in courses at RAL develop my \Cplusplus programming experience.

%% I was most proud of my ability to solve technical problems that other people were stuck on.

%% Studied the effect of unresponsive (``dead'') electromagnetic calorimeter cells and on-detector electronics boards on electron trigger efficiencies with respect to the standard physics channels $\W\rightarrow\enu$, $\Z\rightarrow\ee$ and $H\rightarrow\ZZstar\rightarrow\eeee$. Demonstrated that the electron trigger efficiency decreases by no more than 1\% per 1\% increase in dead calorimeter cells and electronics boards.

%Performed detailed time profiling of code and devised improvements that made it 8 times faster.

%% Developed a trigger algorithm widely used by algorithm developers as an exemplar for integrating their code with the \HLT software framework.

%% Author of a trigger algorithm used as an exemplar by algorithm developers integrating their code with the \HLT core software.
