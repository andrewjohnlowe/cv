\toprule
I am a data scientist, ex-particle physicist and ex-time metrologist with over a decade's worth of experience working at the forefront of scientific research within large international collaborations. I have a PhD in particle physics and spent several years based at the \htmladdnormallink{European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)}{http://home.cern/} in Geneva and was a member of the \htmladdnormallink{team}{http://atlas.cern/} that discovered the \htmladdnormallink{Higgs boson}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson}, the \htmladdnormallink{observation}{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200857X} of which led to the award of the \htmladdnormallink{2013 Nobel Prize in Physics}{http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/}. My core competencies include
statistical data analysis, 
machine learning,
%data mining, 
\htmladdnormallink{high-speed real-time data analysis (``Big Fast Data'')}{http://biconsulting.hu/letoltes/2015budapestdata/budapestdata2015_loweandrewjohn.pdf}, 
quantitative problem solving in cross-functional teams,
software development, 
%Monte Carlo simulation,
mathematical modelling, 
%large-scale computing,
data visualisation 
and interpretation of results. I am a co-author of more than 400 peer-reviewed scientific \htmladdnormallink{publications}{http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/A.Lowe.1} and have spoken in numerous international workshops and conferences.%Andrew Lowe is a particle physicist at the Wigner Research Centre for Physics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, in Budapest. He spent several years based at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva and was a member of the collaboration that discovered the Higgs boson. He played a major role in the development of the core software and algorithms for a real-time multi-stage cascade classifier that filters and reduces the collision event data rate from 60 TB/s to a manageable 300 MB/s that can be written to permanent storage for subsequent offline analysis. He now works on using machine learning techniques to develop classification algorithms for recognising particles based on their decay properties.

%scientific report writing, giving presentations, quantitative analysis, wave knowledge, problem-solving skills and computer programming. technical writing skills, which is critical in my career. A key part of my role is to articulate complex problems to others and create technical solutions, and these skills, I learnt from my Physics Degree.  
%    Mathematics, fundamentals (the way things work!)
%    MS Office applications (communication skills)
%    Writing skills: reports, presentations, lab books
%    Logical, rational thinking
%    Problem-solving skills
%    To be the blank piece of paper that can fold into anything.

% Scientific method  - Much of management is about maximising opportunities and problem-solving; whether you choose a career in medical sciences, corporate finance or engineering. The ability to objectively analyse a difficult problem and weigh up the possible solutions is a great grounding for your career.
